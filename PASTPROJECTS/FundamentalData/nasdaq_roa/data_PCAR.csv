"Texas Instruments, Inc. is an original equipment manufacturer of analog, mixed signal and digital signal processing (DSP) integrated circuits. TI has manufacturing and design facilities, including wafer fabrication and assembly/test operations in North America, Asia and Europe. Management's strategy has been to build assets that would be fully utilized through their lifetimes and outsource any excess demand in peak situations to outside foundries. Analog products have been categorized into three: high performance analog, high volume analog and logic, and power management. The Embedded Processing segment includes TI's OMAP, connectivity solutions, non-wireless DSPs and microprocessors. The Other segment includes smaller semiconductor product lines, such as DLP products, RISC microprocessors and ASICs, calculators and other schoolroom tools, and royalties. The company's products are sold in industrial, personal electronics, automotive, communications, enterprise and other end-markets.","Texas Instruments, Inc. is an original equipment manufacturer of analog, mixed signal and digital signal processing (DSP) integrated circuits.
