    "## Title: Exploring Machine Learning Approaches in Algorithmic Trading Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to delve into algorithmic trading strategies utilizing machine learning (ML) techniques. Algorithmic trading has gained significant traction in financial markets, employing ML methods to make informed trading decisions based on historical data, market trends, and relevant factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Importance:\n",
    "\n",
    "This project holds significance both on a personal level and for a broader audience. Personally, both Costanza and I are intrigued by the application of ML in various domains. I find this project particularly engaging as it merges my interests in finance and ML into potentially impactful work. From a broader perspective, algorithmic trading's influence on market dynamics and investment strategies is substantial. Hence, understanding and developing effective algorithmic trading strategies are crucial for investors, financial institutions, and researchers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Computational Tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "Our project involves leveraging various computational tools, particularly Python along with libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and scikit-learn for data analysis and ML model development. Additionally, we intend to explore advanced ML techniques using deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch. Financial data APIs and platforms will also be utilized for accessing historical market data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We plan to pursue two primary objectives. Firstly, we aim to explore various kernel methods encompassing kernel ridge regression and Support Vector Machines to optimize individual investor stock portfolios. Secondly, we aim to implement time-series optimization schemes within our kernels to enhance predictive capabilities using historical market data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Gains:\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this project, we anticipate gaining a deeper understanding of algorithmic trading strategies and the practical application of ML in finance. Our specific objectives include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Exploring diverse ML algorithms and techniques suitable for predicting financial markets.\n",
    "- Implementing and evaluating trading strategies based on ML models.\n",
    "- Analyzing strategy performance using historical market data.\n",
    "- Gaining insights into the challenges and limitations of algorithmic trading in real-world scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "By achieving these goals, we aim to enhance our knowledge and skills in quantitative finance and ML, which can prove valuable for academic pursuits and potential career opportunities down the line.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Team Breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "I will oversee the financial aspects of the project, including data acquisition and developing appropriate objective functions and financial schemas for model evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Costanza will focus on the ML component, involving statistical techniques for data preprocessing, model development, and implementation. I will assist her in the ML component as well. We will jointly conduct statistical analysis to interpret results effectively, leveraging our combined expertise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both Costanza and I will collaborate on researching suitable kernels for the project and share responsibilities in development efforts.\n"
